# Clockwork 5.3 released with HTTP requests and more

A new minor [Clockwork](https://underground.works/clockwork) release is now available, adding **HTTP requests support, improved vanilla integration and more**.

### HTTP Requests

Clockwork now **collects HTTP requests** made by your application and presents them in **a new HTTP tab**. Requests made with **the Laravel HTTP client** will be automatically collected and you can [easily set up](https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork/pull/693) any library using **Guzzle** to collect the requests.

You can **expand a request**, to inspect it's request and response data, headers, timing and other metrics.

### Vanilla Integration

Clockwork now includes **a zero-configuration support** for applications compatible with the PSR-15 standard, with [**a new PSR-15 middleware**](https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork/pull/689). This is now the best way to use Clockwork with various **micro-frameworks**, like Slim or Mezzio.

For more information about how to use the new middleware, check out the [**installation instructions**](https://underground.works/clockwork/#docs-installation-vanilla) on the Clockwork website.

With this change we've also deprecated the Slim middleware, to be removed in Clockwork 6. You should use the new PSR-15 middleware instead.

Thanks to [UlrichEckhardt](https://github.com/UlrichEckhardt) and [DominicDetta](https://github.com/DominicDetta) for their work on the vanilla integration improvements.

### Manifest v3

The **Clockwork Chrome extension** has been recently updated to **Manifest v3**, which is **required by Google** for all extensions going forward. While this should have **no impact** on the user-experience, it's currently not working properly for some users using **self-signed HTTPS certificates**, because of [a Chrome bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40882068).

In Clockwork 5.3 we have **improved the error messaging** when loading Clockwork metadata, to better handle various connection errors. The Xdebug profile loading has also been improved to better handle invalid profiles.

### Other Improvements

The Clockwork app has been finally **updated to use Vue 3** and Vite build stack, which should bring a minor performance improvement.

Symfony integration has been improved to support **Symfony 6 and 7**. Doctrine integration has been improved to support [**Doctrine 3 and 4**](https://github.com/itsgoingd/clockwork/pull/720). And Monolog integration has been improved to support **Monolog 2 and 3**.

Clockwork now **supports PHP 8.4** and for the first time in 4 years, we changed the **minimal required PHP version** to **PHP 7.1**. This should only affect 0.2% users, who can continue using Clockwork 5.2.

While working on this release, I've resolved more than 60 GitHub issues, dating back to 2019. To see a full list of improvements and fixes see the [**changelog**](https://underground.works/clockwork/#changelog).
