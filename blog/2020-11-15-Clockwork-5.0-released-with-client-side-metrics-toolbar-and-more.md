# Clockwork 5.0 released with client-side metrics, toolbar and more

A new major [Clockwork](https://underground.works/clockwork) release is finally available. With **UI refinements, client-side metrics, models and notifications tabs, sharing, toolbar and more**.

Clockwork 5 supports the **latest Laravel**, **Lumen**, **Slim** and **Symfony** releases. To upgrade to the latest version simply change the version constraint in your `composer.json`:

```
"itsgoingd/clockwork": "^5.0",
```

### UI refinements

Almost **every part** of the Clockwork UI **was touched up and improved**. From simplified requests list, new tab bar, counters and tables to reworked dark theme colors.

The **tab bar was completely reworked** to be more clear and responsive. Every section now has **consistent iconography**. Tables now have always visible **search fields**. Request **sidebar now shows basic request information**. The **clear button and requests search were moved** to the requests list itself. Settings and "what's new" dialog use an **all new modal style**. Log messages now have **linkified urls**. These are just few highlights.

You will also find a new **"credits"** link in the settings modal. This opens a credits modal with a little **shout-out to all contributors, sponsors and used third-party dependencies**.

### Timeline

Timeline was **rebuilt from the ground up** in this release. The new timeline makes it **easier than ever before to figure out what's happening** in your application. The **condense option** makes the timeline more compact by condensing **multiple short events into a single row**. The **bar colors** now represent the **event type** and show the **self and children time** in different shades. Clicking on an event now reveals a **popover with more details**. And of course you can still **filter by event type, search and show details view**.

The **timeline api** on server-side was also completely reworked. It's way **more developer-friendly** and supports **custom event colors**. See [**the updated docs**](https://underground.works/clockwork/#docs-timeline) for details and how to upgrade an existing project. The default **Laravel** initializing events were also replaced with a way **more useful controller event**.

<code class="block">// using timeline api with begin/end and fluent configuration
clock()->event('Importing tweets')->color('purple')->begin();
...
clock()->event('Importing tweets')->end();
&nbsp;
// using timeline api with run and array-based configuration
clock()->event('Updating cache', [ 'color' => 'green' ])->run(function () {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
});
</code>

### Client-metrics and Web Vitals

Clockwork helps you to keep your **server-side performance** in check. Optimizing the backend is **just half of the battle** though. **Javascript processing** can still make your application feel sluggish. Fortunately we have some great **web performance intiatives like [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/)** and browser apis to help us measure how are we doing on this front.

With Clockwork 5 you are now be able to **collect these client-side performance metrics**. Supported are both **navigation timings** (like how long it took for the DOM interactive or complete event) and **Web Vitals**. You will find the collected metrics in a **new client-side section in the performance tab**.

Collecting client-side metrics **requires installing a tiny javascript library** from npm or simply linking <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> from a cdn. Check the docs for **[more details](https://underground.works/clockwork/#docs-client-metrics)**.

### Models tab

Models tab is a **new tool** in your toolbelt **for dealing with database issues**. **Models actions** give you **a different point of view** at your database usage. You can see **see every time a model was retrieved, created, updated or deleted**, with primary keys and even changed data and executed query. **Models counts** will show you **how many of each model you've retrieved, created, updated and deleted**.

### Notifications tab

Notifications tab is a new tab **replacing the emails tab**. This time we support not only emails, but **all kinds of notifications**, like SMS or Slack messages. With details like subject, recipient, sender, but also notifiable, notified and mailable objects in Larvel. You can also **preview sent emails** content.

### Sharing

Have you ever wanted to share a Clockwork profile with someone else? Maybe you'd like to share details of a crash from a local environment with a co-worker. Or before and after optimisation metrics with your boss.

**Sharing a request uploads the metadata** to a Clockwork share service and **gives you a public link** to share with others. On this link you will find a **fully working Clockwork app** showing the request you shared. Append .png to the url and you will get **a screenshot of the performance tab** you can easily embed to a GitHub issue. You can also choose to **share only part of the request**, like the database tab.

The share service is **free to use**. The shared data is hosted on DigitalOcean servers and will never be shared with third-parties. Old shares will be purged form time to time. You can also **delete the shared requests** manually **at any time**.

Sometimes you might just want to **link to a request on your own Clockwork instance**. You will find that the request id on the bottom of the sidebar now links to the current request.

### Toolbar

Many of the popular web profilers, like [Laravel Debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) or [Symfony Profiler](https://symfony.com/doc/current/profiler.html), come with a sort of toolbar injected to your website, showing the collected metrics. In Clockwork I went with a different approach, keeping the profiler separate from the rest of the app.

The **toolbar approach has some unique advantages** though. With a separate profiler you need to go looking for the profiling data, with a toolbar you **always have your eyes on the metrics**. This can help you **notice performance issues** that you wouldn't normally look for.

If you like this approach, **Clockwork now gives you the option**. We still don't inject anything into your website, instead **the whole toolbar is implemented client-side**. The toolbar **has to be enabled** in the config and **a tiny browser component installed** from npm or simply `<script>` linked from cdn. See the docs for **[full installation instructions](https://underground.works/clockwork/#docs-viewing-data)**.

![Toolbar](/images/blog/2020-11-15-Clockwork-5.0-released-with-client-side-metrics-toolbar-and-more/toolbar.png)

The toolbar shows **only simple metrics**. Clicking on the blue arrow will open Clockwork app with full details.

### Other improvements

Clockwork 5 also comes with some **behind the scenes improvements**. Loading of the metadata is now **automatically retried** and has **better error handling**. The **polling interval is now dynamically increased** when there are no requests to show, lowering the load on your server. **Polling throttling** for inactive tabs now **also works in extension**. Partial loads of the metadata are now possible.

The Clockwork php library comes with a bundled Clockwork app. The **default path for this web UI is now your.app/clockwork**. You can also change this path in the Clockwork config.

The php library now gives you **a lot more options on which requests to collect and record**. **On-demand mode** will collect data **only when Clockwork app is open**. You can even specify a secret to be set in the app settings to collect request. **Errors only** will record only **requests ending with 4xx and 5xx** responses. **Slow only** will collect only requests with responses above the set **slow threshold**. You can also filter the collected and recorded requests by **a custom closure**. CORS pre-flight requests will not be collected by default.

Requests recording was moved to a terminate callback. This **lowers the overhead** Clockwork has on your response time by **up to 50%**. A **Slim 4 support** has also been added.

### Breaking changes and community

As this is a major release it comes with **a few breaking changes**.

Slim middleware namespaces have changes, please see [the documentation](https://underground.works/clockwork/#docs-installation-slim). Minimal supported PHP version was bumped to 5.6.
