# Clockwork 5.1 released with database queries highlighting and more

A new minor [Clockwork](https://underground.works/clockwork) release is now available. Adding **database queries highlighting, Laravel Octane support, Edge extension, bunch of fixes and more**.

### Database queries highlighting

Debugging database queries is now easier than ever before with **SQL syntax highlighting** in the database tab. You can also enable the **prettify mode** to reformat the queries for even more readibility.

These features were contributed largely by [Edgard Lorraine Messias](https://github.com/edgardmessias), thanks!

### Laravel Octane Support

Clockwork 5.1 is the **first release to support** the recently released Laravel's application server offering **Laravel Octane**.

All features are fully supported, except for a slight limitation when filtering requests, where even flitered requests incur the performance overhead of Clockwork when running on Octane. Expect this integration to improve in a future version.

### Edge extension

Clockwork arrives at a new platform with it's 5.1 release. **Microsoft Edge extension is now available**, with full feature parity with the Chrome and Firefox extensions.

The extension is currently in review and should be available on the [Edge Add-ons page](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/) shortly.

### Other improvements

Request URLs are now collected **including the query string**, so you can copy the full url out of Clockwork. URLs with non-standard ports are now also collected correctly.

**Laravel cache queries** can now be **collected without their values**, which is the new default behavior. Collected Laravel routes can now be filtered by their namespace. **Vanilla integration** now supports the **Web UI**, see the [documentation](https://underground.works/clockwork/#docs-installation-vanilla) for instructions.

Fixed an issue where **Data section of the sidebar** could contain unexpected data and improved its styles. **Stack traces popups** should no longer overflow the content section. High-precision timings from **Xdebug 3 profiles** are now correctly displayed. Firefox extension had an issue with **cookies handling**, this was resolved.

PHP 8 incompatibility when collecting certain kinds of Laravel notifications was also fixed.

For a full list of improvements and fixes see the **[changelog](https://underground.works/clockwork/#changelog)**.

The next on the schedule is the major **Clockwork 6.0 release**, expected to be released in late fall.
